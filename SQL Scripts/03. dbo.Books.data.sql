He has been one of the most dynamic leaders of modern times; few British prime ministers have shaped the nation''s course as profoundly as Blair during his ten years in power, and his achievements and his legacy will be debated for years to come. Now his memoirs reveal in intimate detail this unique political and personal journey, providing an insight into the man, the politician and the statesman, and charting successes, controversies and disappointments with an extraordinary candour. A Journey will prove essential and compulsive reading for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of our global world. As an account of the nature and uses of power, it will also have a readership that extends well beyond politics, to all those who want to understand the challenges of leadership today. About the Author : - Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh in 1953. He became MP for Sedgefield in 1983, leader of the Labour Party in 1994 and prime minister of the United Kingdom from May 1997 to June 2007. Since leaving Downing Street, Tony Blair has served as the Quartet Representative to the Middle East. He represents the USA, UN, Russia and EU, working with the Palestinians to prepare for statehood as part of the international community s effort to secure peace. In May 2008 he launched the Tony Blair Faith Foundation which promotes respect and understanding between the major religions and makes the case for faith as a force for good in the modern world. His Africa Governance Initiative delivers projects in Rwanda and Sierra Leone and Liberia, advising the leaders and their governments on policy delivery and attracting investment. As the first major head of government to bring climate change to the top of the international political agenda at the 2005 G8 summit, Tony Blair works with world leaders to build consensus on an international climate policy framework. In recognition of his debt to the North East of England, he has launched The Tony Blair Sports Foundation, to increase opportunities for young people to participate in sport. He is married to Cherie Booth QC, and they have four children.', 0, N'2022-10-14 05:56:47', NULL, N'/images/books/thumb/55eeeafe-e7d0-47bd-9a46-33a7a0e14c70.jpg', NULL)

Despite a prickly relationship and very different lives, they''ve never quite lost touch with each other - or with their former teacher, Libor Sevcik, a Czech always more concerned with the wider world than with exam results. Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower, they dine at Libor''s grand, central London apartment. It''s a sweetly painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it. Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all because that way you have less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough for the unbearable sadness of both his friends'' losses. And it''s that very evening, at exactly 11:30 pm, as Treslove, walking home, hesitates a moment outside the window of the oldest violin dealer in the country, that he is attacked. And after this, his whole sense of who and what he is will slowly and ineluctably change.

Her favorite word is ''MINE!'' and her penchant for Balenciaga bags, Chanel sunglasses, and online purchases has no rival under age five. Becky is at her wits end. On top of this, she and her husband Luke are still living with her parents. Thankfully it appears house buying attempt number four is a go! Until a huge financial crisis causes panic everywhere, and nobody wants to shop - not Becky''s personal shopping clientele, not her friends, nobody.

Will Becky manage to keep the party of the year a surprise? Can she hire jugglers, fire-eaters, and acrobats at a discount? Will enlisting the help of Luke''s unflappable assistant to convince him to have another baby realize her dream of matching pom-poms?

The two wars were the worst we had ever known and the episodes of peace among the most turbulent and surprising.

His ambition has always been to travel across the country on a quest to capture the very essence of Italian cooking - and to produce the best and simplest Italian cookbook for everybody to enjoy. Jamie''s Italy is a result of that journey - and it''s a land of plenty. With more than 120 brand-new recipes for everything from risotto to roasts and spaghetti to stews, and structured like a traditional trattoria menu, Jamie''s Italy takes you all over Italy to cook with and learn from the real masters of Italian cuisine: the locals. Far from the standard ''lemons and olives'' version of Italian cooking, it is a cookbook by the people for the people. From Sicily to Tuscany, it''s about the local fishermen, family bakers and, of course, the ''Mamas'', sharing their recipes and the tips that have gone into their cooking for generations. But it''s not only mouth-watering food that Jamie brings back home: it''s also the spirit that makes cooking and eating absolutely central to family life whichever part of Italy you''re in. Bursting with the warmth and hospitality of real family life, this is both a superbly accessible cookbook and a unique travelogue and diary, in which you''ll find the authentic flavour of Italy and the people who live there.
